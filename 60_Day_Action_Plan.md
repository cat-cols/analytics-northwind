---

### Behavioral Prep (1-2 hours/week)

**Prepare STAR stories for:**

1. **Tell me about yourself**
```
"I've spent the last 2 years building data analysis skills through self-directed 
study. I became passionate about data when I realized how powerful insights can 
drive business decisions. I've focused on SQL, Python, and Tableau, and built 
a portfolio of projects analyzing real-world datasets. My Portland Airbnb analysis 
revealed that superhosts command an 18% premium while maintaining higher ratings. 
I'm excited to bring this analytical mindset to [Company]'s team."
```

2. **Why data analytics?**
```
"I love solving puzzles and finding patterns. Data analytics combines my 
analytical skills with business impact. When I analyzed Portland crime data, 
I discovered a 23% decrease in violent crime over 3 years - that kind of 
insight can inform policy decisions. I want to help companies make better 
decisions through data."
```

3. **Walk me through a project**
```
[Pick your SQL project - know it cold]
"I analyzed an e-commerce database with 10,000 transactions. I started by 
exploring the data to understand the schema, then wrote SQL queries to answer 
key business questions. My most interesting finding was that the top 20% of 
customers generated 67% of revenue, which suggests focusing retention efforts 
on high-value customers. I used window functions to calculate customer lifetime 
value and CTEs to segment customers by purchase behavior."
```

4. **How do you handle ambiguity?**
```
"In my Portland Airbnb project, the dataset had missing values and inconsistent 
formatting. I started by documenting all the issues, then prioritized which ones 
would most impact the analysis. For missing prices, I used median imputation 
within neighborhood groups. For inconsistent categories, I created a mapping 
table. I documented every decision in my code so the analysis is reproducible."
```

5. **Tell me about a time you made a mistake**
```
"In my crime analysis project, I initially forgot to account for population 
differences between neighborhoods, which made some areas look worse than they 
actually were. When I reviewed my results, something felt off. I went back, 
normalized the data by population, and the insights changed significantly. 
This taught me to always validate my assumptions and sanity-check results 
before presenting."
```

**Common Questions to Prepare:**
- Why are you interested in this company?
- What's your greatest strength/weakness?
- How do you stay current with data trends?
- Describe your ideal work environment
- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
- Why should we hire you despite the employment gap?

---

### Addressing Employment Gap

**Be prepared for:** "I see you haven't worked in a few years. Can you explain?"

**Good Answer:**
```
"I took time to focus on [family responsibilities / health recovery / completing 
education - pick what's true]. During that time, I discovered my passion for data 
analytics and invested heavily in building skills. Rather than rushing back into 
any job, I wanted to be fully prepared, so I spent 2 years learning SQL, Python, 
and Tableau, and built a portfolio of projects. I'm now ready to contribute 
immediately and bring fresh energy to the role."
```

**What NOT to say:**
- ❌ "I couldn't find a job" (sounds defeatist)
- ❌ Long explanations about personal issues
- ❌ Apologetic tone
- ❌ Blame external factors

**What TO emphasize:**
- ✅ What you DID during the gap (learned, built portfolio)
- ✅ You're ready NOW (energized, prepared)
- ✅ Redirect to your skills and projects
- ✅ Confident, forward-looking tone
